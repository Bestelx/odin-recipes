            filled with a savory mixture of ground meat and 
            diced vegetables. The wraps are neatly arranged on 
            a white plate, with each lettuce leaf serving as a 
            vessel for the filling. The filling consists of 
            seasoned ground beef, chopped green onions, and 
            bits of vegetables, topped with a few sprigs of 
            fresh cilantro for garnish. The dish appears fresh 
            and appetizing, with the vibrant green of the 
            lettuce contrasting nicely with the rich, brown hue 
            of the meat mixture. The background is a simple, 
            light-colored surface, keeping the focus on the 
            colorful and enticing dish."
