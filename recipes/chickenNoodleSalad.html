        Get ready to make all sorts of friends when you bring a big
         bowl of this Asian chicken noodle salad to the next big 
         cookout. The only folks you might scare away are the ones 
         who brought regular pasta salads. There's just something 
         delightfully addictive about this special combination of 
         cold and spicy. This recipe is the perfect catchall for 
         all those summer vegetables we're supposed to be eating 
         more of, as well as any dry leftover chicken you have 
         around.

            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>tablespoon Sriracha chile sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 cooked chicken breast</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
            <li>1 cup grated carrots</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped roasted, salted peanuts</li>
            <li>⅓ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>⅓ cup chopped fresh mint</li>
            <li>⅓ cup chopped cilantro</li>
        </ul>
    </p>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk garlic, rice vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce,
                 brown sugar, Sriracha, hoisin, and sesame oil
                  together in a mixing bowl for the dressing.
                </li>

            <li>Tear chicken apart into strands similar in width to
                 the spaghetti. Refrigerate until ready to use.
                </li>

            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a 
                boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, 
                stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm 
                to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and 
                rinse with cold water.
            </li>

            <li>Transfer spaghetti to a mixing bowl; add the 
                chicken, carrots, bell pepper, and green onions. 
                Pour in the dressing and toss by hand until well 
                combined. Seal the surface of the salad with 
                plastic wrap and refrigerate, tossing occasionally, 
                for 2 to 12 hours, the longer the better.                
            </li>

            <li>Add peanuts, basil, mint, and cilantro to the salad. 
                Toss well; taste and adjust for seasoning.
            </li>
            
            <li>Cover with foil and bake.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna rest before serving.</li>

        </ol>
