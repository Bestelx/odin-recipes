                alt="A close-up image of a plate of lettuce wraps 
                filled with a savory mixture of ground meat and 
                diced vegetables. The wraps are neatly arranged on 
                a white plate, with each lettuce leaf serving as a 
                vessel for the filling. The filling consists of 
                seasoned ground beef, chopped green onions, and 
                bits of vegetables, topped with a few sprigs of 
                fresh cilantro for garnish. The dish appears fresh 
                and appetizing, with the vibrant green of the 
                lettuce contrasting nicely with the rich, brown hue 
                of the meat mixture. The background is a simple, 
                light-colored surface, keeping the focus on the 
                colorful and enticing dish."

        These lettuce wraps are bursting with Asian flavors, 
        delicious, and a great idea for entertaining or a 
        family-style meal. To serve, allow each person to spoon a 
        portion of the beef mixture into a lettuce leaf. Wrap the 
        lettuce around the beef like a burrito and enjoy!

            <li>1 bunch green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Asian (dark) sesame oil</li>
        </ul>
    </p>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse whole lettuce leaves and pat dry, being 
                careful not to tear them; set aside.
                </li>

            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Add beef; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 
                5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease; transfer 
                beef to a bowl. Add onion to the same skillet; 
                cook and stir until just tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
                </li>

            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a 
                boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, 
                stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm 
                to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and 
                rinse with cold water.
            </li>

            <li>Stir in hoisin sauce, garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, 
                ginger, and chile pepper sauce until well combined. 
                Add water chestnuts, green onions, sesame oil, and 
                cooked beef; cook and stir until the onions just 
                begin to wilt, about 2 minutes.               
            </li>

            <li>Arrange lettuce leaves around the outer edge of a large serving platter; spoon beef mixture in the center.
            </li>
            
            <li>Cover with foil and bake.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna rest before serving.</li>

        </ol>
